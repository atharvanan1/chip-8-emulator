CHIP-8:
- There are a lot of full tutorials on the Internet, so just searching "chip8 emulator tutorial" and looking for one in your language of choice should be enough if you're looking for a step-by-step guide.
- If not, see 'References' below. There are no "full" tutorials for other systems, so doing this is a bit challenging but more realistic and perhaps more helpful in the long run, assuming you'll want to move on to other systems after CHIP-8.
